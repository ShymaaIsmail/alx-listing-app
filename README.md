## About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** serves as the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone, developed using **Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint**. This milestone focuses on establishing a clean, scalable codebase with a well-organized folder structure and reusable components, adhering to best practices for a dynamic, responsive property listing page.

### Key Features:

* **Project Setup:** Scaffold a Next.js app with TypeScript, ESLint, and TailwindCSS.
* **Folder Structure:** Implement modular directories for components, interfaces, constants, and assets.
* **Reusable Components:** Develop foundational components like `Card` and `Button` to promote consistency.
* **TypeScript Integration:** Define interfaces to ensure type safety and maintainability.
* **Asset Management:** Organize images and SVGs in the `public/assets` folder for easy access.
